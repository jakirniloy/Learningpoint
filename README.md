# Learningpoint
#Introduction
The name of our project is “Learning Point”. It is an online based educational platform where students can share their knowledge. Our purpose is to help the students of our university to concentrate on their study and to make the learning process easier. The users of this project will be the students of East West University. 
Because of the pandemic situation students are unable to study in groups or discus class lectures. Naturally students help each other by sharing their knowledge. Our target is to bring that experience through online.  

#Motivation
During this pandemic situation caused by covid-19,we are all locked down in our houses. 
There is no way to study in groups or to mentor each other which is very common among students in normal situation. 
So, we have been thinking the possible ways to solve this problem for quite some time.
Then, we have come across this idea to help each other out and get the essence of the enjoyment of learning new things instead of feeling frustrated.
